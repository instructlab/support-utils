# InstructLab User Utility Scripts

This repository contains scripts that enhance the InstructLab implementation of the LAB Methodology.

The `support-utils` repo is a place where the maintainers of the InstructLab project can collect and curate them for the benefit of the community.

Scripts in this repository may become features or incorporated in the InstructLab Core repository after use and review by users and developers.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains two categories of scripts. Scripts either live in the `hack` and `beta` directories.

```bash
support-utils
|
|
|- beta
|
|- hack
```

The `hack` directory is open for the contribution of scripts of any quality.

Scripts in the `beta` directory will be required to have documentation, and automated functional testing.
These scripts are meant to be run by users for feedback and may graduate into full blown features in other InstructLab repos.

Pull requests maybe opened into either directory.

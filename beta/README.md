# Scripts for Beta Testing

The `support-utils` repository contains two categories of scripts. Scripts either live in the `hack` and `beta` directories.

Scripts in the `beta` directory are meant to be beta tested by the community.

```bash
support-utils
|
|
|- beta
```

Scripts living in `beta` are required to have documentation, and automated functional testing.
These scripts are meant may graduate into full blown features in other InstructLab repos, after opening up a [dev-doc](https://github.com/instructlab/dev-docs)
